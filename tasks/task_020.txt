# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Structured Logging and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement structured logging, metrics collection, and error monitoring as specified in NFR 7.
# Details:
1. Implement structured JSON logging:
   - Configure logging at INFO level for business events
   - Configure logging at DEBUG level for calculation internals
   - Configure logging at ERROR level for stack traces
   - Ensure PII redaction (hash base_salary and employee_id in logs)

2. Implement metrics collection using Prometheus:
   - Track bonus_calc_duration_seconds (histogram, labeled mode=individual|batch)
   - Track batch_job_rows_total (counter)
   - Track bonus_cap_applied_total (counter, labeled type=3x|mrt)
   - Configure Prometheus client and endpoints

3. Implement distributed tracing:
   - Configure OpenTelemetry
   - Inject trace-ids into every log line
   - Create spans for key operations

4. Implement error monitoring with Sentry:
   - Configure Sentry DSN
   - Forward uncaught exceptions with calculation context
   - Add custom context to error reports

5. Create dashboards for monitoring system health and performance

The observability implementation should provide comprehensive visibility into the system's operation, performance, and errors to facilitate troubleshooting and optimization.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify log format and content at different log levels
2. Test PII redaction in logs
3. Verify metrics are correctly registered and updated
4. Test trace propagation across service boundaries
5. Test error reporting to Sentry
6. Verify dashboard functionality
7. Test under load to ensure logging doesn't impact performance
8. Verify logs contain all required information for troubleshooting
