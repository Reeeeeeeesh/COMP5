# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 15, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive testing suite to ensure the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
# Details:
1. Implement unit tests:
   - Test all calculation functions
   - Test UI components
   - Test API endpoints
   - Test data validation

2. Implement integration tests:
   - Test complete calculation flows
   - Test batch processing end-to-end
   - Test database interactions

3. Implement end-to-end tests:
   - Test user workflows for individual calculations
   - Test user workflows for batch processing
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. Implement performance tests:
   - Test calculation speed for individual calculations
   - Test batch processing performance
   - Test UI responsiveness

5. Implement accessibility tests:
   - Test compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Test screen reader compatibility

6. Set up continuous integration pipeline:
   - Run tests automatically on code changes
   - Generate test coverage reports
   - Enforce minimum test coverage

7. Implement test data generation:
   - Create test data for various scenarios
   - Include edge cases from the truth tables in sections 11 and 13 of the PRD

The testing suite should provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality and ensure that it meets all requirements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test coverage for all components and functions
2. Test with the truth table cases from sections 11 and 13 of the PRD
3. Test with edge cases and invalid inputs
4. Test accessibility compliance
5. Test performance under various conditions
6. Test browser compatibility
7. Test on various devices and screen sizes
