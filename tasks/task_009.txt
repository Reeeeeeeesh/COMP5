# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Side-by-Side Scenario Comparison
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop functionality to compare two saved individual scenarios side by side as specified in FR5.2.
# Details:
1. Design and implement UI for scenario comparison:
   - Dropdown selectors for choosing two scenarios to compare
   - Side-by-side display of inputs and outputs for both scenarios
   - Visual indicators for differences between scenarios

2. Implement comparison logic:
   - Load two selected scenarios
   - Calculate results for both scenarios
   - Identify differences in inputs and outputs
   - Highlight significant differences

3. Create a tabular view showing:
   - Input parameters for both scenarios
   - Intermediate calculation results for both scenarios
   - Final bonus amounts for both scenarios
   - Percentage or absolute difference between final bonuses

4. Add option to export comparison as CSV

The comparison should clearly show which inputs differ between scenarios and how those differences affect the final bonus calculation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for comparison functions
2. Test comparing scenarios with various differences
3. Test the highlighting of differences
4. Test the export functionality
5. Test with edge cases (very similar scenarios, very different scenarios)
6. Verify that the comparison is clear and understandable
