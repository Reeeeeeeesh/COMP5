# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Data Validation and Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive data validation and security measures as specified in NFR2.
# Details:
1. Implement input validation:
   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
   - Implement type checking and range validation
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs

2. Implement secure data transmission:
   - Configure HTTPS for all data transmission
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Set secure and HTTP-only flags for cookies

3. Implement data encryption:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure encryption algorithms and key management

4. Implement secure file upload:
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Store uploaded files securely

5. Implement rate limiting and protection against abuse:
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add protection against brute force attacks

6. Create a data privacy policy and user agreement

The security implementation should protect user data and the system from various threats while ensuring compliance with UK GDPR and other relevant regulations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Penetration testing for common vulnerabilities
2. Test input validation with various invalid inputs
3. Verify HTTPS configuration and certificate validity
4. Test file upload with various file types and sizes
5. Test rate limiting and CSRF protection
6. Verify data encryption at rest
7. Test for common security issues (OWASP Top 10)
8. Conduct a security review of the entire application
