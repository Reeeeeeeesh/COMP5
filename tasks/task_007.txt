# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Policy & Cap Adjustments
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the policy and cap adjustment features as specified in FR3.5, including MRT Cap and salary band breach alerts.
# Details:
1. Create UI components for policy and cap inputs:
   - Input field for MRT Cap Percentage
   - Interface for defining salary bands

2. Implement calculation functions:
   - Apply MRT Cap to calculated bonus
   - Apply 3x Base Salary cap to calculated bonus
   - Check for salary band breaches

3. Implement alert system for policy breaches:
   - Visual indicator when Final Bonus > 3 Ã— Base Salary
   - Visual indicator when bonus is capped by MRT Cap
   - Visual indicator for salary band breaches

4. Add toggle for enabling/disabling specific caps

5. Ensure cap application follows the correct precedence (apply the lower of multiple caps)

The implementation should handle all edge cases from the truth table in section 13 of the PRD, particularly T4 and T5 which involve cap application.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all cap calculation functions
2. Test scenarios where different caps are applied
3. Test scenarios where multiple caps could apply to verify correct precedence
4. Verify alert displays work correctly for each type of policy breach
5. Test with the truth table cases from section 11 of the PRD, particularly T4 and T5
6. Test with edge cases where caps are just barely exceeded or just barely not exceeded
