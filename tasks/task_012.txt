# Task ID: 12
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for storing batch data, scenarios, and calculation results as needed for the batch processing functionality.
# Details:
1. Design database schema for:
   - Batch uploads (temporary storage)
   - Batch scenarios (saved parameter sets)
   - Batch calculation results
   - Session management for anonymous users

2. Implement database migrations using Alembic:
   - Create initial migration for core tables
   - Set up indexes for performance
   - Configure constraints for data integrity

3. Implement data models using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic:
   - Define ORM models for all tables
   - Define Pydantic models for API validation
   - Ensure models match the data dictionary in section 12.1 of the PRD

4. Implement data access layer:
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - Query functions for common operations
   - Transaction management

5. Implement data retention policy:
   - Automatic deletion of temporary batch data after 24 hours
   - Cleanup of old calculation results

6. Ensure proper encryption of sensitive data

The database schema should be designed to support efficient batch processing and scenario management while maintaining data security and privacy.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all data models and CRUD operations
2. Integration tests with a test database
3. Test data migration scripts
4. Test data retention policy
5. Performance testing with large datasets
6. Security testing for data encryption
7. Test concurrent access scenarios
