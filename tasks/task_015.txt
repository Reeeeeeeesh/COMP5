# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Batch Processing Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 12, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend engine for processing batch calculations efficiently as specified in FR7.3.
# Details:
1. Design and implement batch processing architecture:
   - Asynchronous task queue using Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ
   - Worker processes for handling batch calculations
   - Progress tracking and reporting

2. Implement batch calculation functions:
   - Process multiple employee records efficiently
   - Apply global and individual parameters correctly
   - Calculate bonuses for all employees
   - Store calculation results
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. Optimize for performance:
   - Parallel processing where possible
   - Efficient database operations
   - Batched updates

4. Implement progress tracking:
   - Track percentage completion
   - Estimate remaining time
   - Report errors for individual records

5. Add monitoring and logging:
   - Log calculation events
   - Track performance metrics
   - Monitor resource usage

The batch processing engine should be able to handle large batches (up to 500-1000 employees) efficiently while providing feedback on progress and handling errors gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for batch calculation functions
2. Integration tests for the complete batch processing flow
3. Performance testing with various batch sizes
4. Test error handling with invalid data
5. Test progress tracking accuracy
6. Test resource usage under load
7. Test recovery from failures
8. Test with the truth table cases from section 11 of the PRD applied to multiple employees
