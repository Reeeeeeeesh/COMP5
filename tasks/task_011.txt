# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Export Functionality for Individual Calculations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop functionality to export individual calculation results to CSV or printable view as specified in FR4.4.
# Details:
1. Design and implement UI for export options:
   - Button or menu for export options
   - Options for CSV export or printable view

2. Implement export functions:
   - Generate CSV file with all inputs, intermediate calculations, and results
   - Create printable view with formatted calculation breakdown

3. Include in the export:
   - All input parameters
   - All intermediate calculation results
   - Final bonus amount
   - Any alerts or policy breaches
   - Timestamp and scenario name (if applicable)

4. Ensure exported data is well-formatted and easy to understand

5. Add option to include or exclude certain sections in the export

The export functionality should provide a complete record of the calculation that can be saved, shared, or printed.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for export functions
2. Test CSV generation with various calculation scenarios
3. Test printable view formatting
4. Verify that all relevant data is included in the export
5. Test with edge cases (very large numbers, special characters in inputs)
6. Test browser compatibility for export functionality
