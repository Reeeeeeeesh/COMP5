# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Batch Input Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the interface for uploading and configuring batch employee data as specified in FR7.1.
# Details:
1. Design and implement UI for batch data upload:
   - File upload component for CSV/Excel files
   - Template download option
   - Column mapping interface
   - Data validation feedback

2. Implement backend API for batch data upload:
   - Endpoint for receiving uploaded files
   - File parsing and validation
   - Temporary storage of uploaded data
   - Error reporting for invalid data

3. Create downloadable templates for batch data:
   - CSV template with all required columns
   - Example data for reference

4. Implement column mapping functionality:
   - UI for mapping uploaded columns to required fields
   - Automatic mapping suggestion based on column names
   - Validation of mapping completeness

5. Implement data validation:
   - Check for required fields
   - Validate data types and ranges
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid data
   - Show validation summary with counts of valid/invalid rows

The batch input interface should make it easy for users to upload employee data, validate it, and prepare it for batch calculation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for file parsing and validation functions
2. Test with various CSV formats and structures
3. Test column mapping functionality
4. Test validation of required fields and data types
5. Test error reporting for invalid data
6. Test with large files to ensure performance
7. Test template download functionality
8. Test with malformed files to ensure proper error handling
