# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Revenue Adjustment Factor (RAF) Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the RAF component of the calculator with adjustable parameters as specified in FR3.4.
# Details:
1. Create UI components for RAF inputs:
   - Input fields for 3-year rolling average team revenues
   - Input fields for individual yearly revenues for relevant periods
   - Adjustable RAF Sensitivity Factor
   - Adjustable RAF Clamp Values (lower and upper bounds)

2. Implement calculation functions for both RAF models:
   - Standard RAF calculation based on 3-year rolling averages
   - Alternative RAF calculation based on revenue_actual and rev_adjust_ref
   - Apply sensitivity factor and clamp values

3. Provide option to input the final RAF value directly as an alternative

4. Implement real-time updates of the RAF component as inputs change

5. Add validation for all inputs with appropriate constraints

The implementation should support both RAF models mentioned in the PRD:
- Standard model using 3-year rolling average team revenues
- Alternative model using revenue_actual and rev_adjust_ref

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all RAF calculation functions
2. Test both RAF models with various revenue inputs
3. Test the direct input option for final RAF value
4. Test edge cases (very high/low revenues, negative RAF before clamping)
5. Verify real-time updates work correctly
6. Test with the truth table cases from section 11 of the PRD
7. Test edge cases from section 13 of the PRD, particularly T6 and T8 which involve RAF clamping
