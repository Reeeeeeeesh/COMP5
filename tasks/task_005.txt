# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Qualitative Performance Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the qualitative performance component of the calculator with adjustable parameters as specified in FR3.3.
# Details:
1. Create UI components for qualitative performance inputs:
   - Input fields for individual qualitative scores (Risk, Compliance, Teamwork, ESG, Client Outcomes)
   - Adjustable parameters for the score-to-multiplier mapping curve
   - Input for the overall Qualitative Weight

2. Implement calculation functions:
   - Calculate average qualitative score from individual scores
   - Implement the score-to-multiplier mapping function with configurable parameters
   - Calculate the qualitative component contribution to the bonus

3. Provide option to input the Qualitative Score Multiplier directly as an alternative

4. Implement real-time updates of the qualitative component as inputs change

5. Add validation for all inputs with appropriate constraints

The score-to-multiplier mapping should support configuration of:
- Score thresholds for 0x, 1x, 1.2x multipliers
- Custom mapping points if needed

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all calculation functions
2. Test with various qualitative scores to verify correct multiplier calculation
3. Test the direct input option for Qualitative Score Multiplier
4. Test edge cases (very high/low scores)
5. Verify real-time updates work correctly
6. Test with the truth table cases from section 11 of the PRD
