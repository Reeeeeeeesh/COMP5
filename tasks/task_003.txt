# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Individual Calculator UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an intuitive, responsive UI for individual bonus calculations with real-time updates as specified in FR1.
# Details:
1. Design a clean, well-organized layout with clear sections for inputs, parameters, and results
2. Implement form components with appropriate input controls:
   - Numeric inputs for salaries, percentages, scores, revenue figures
   - Sliders for selecting weights
   - Dropdowns for predefined parameter sets
   - Clear labels and tooltips for all fields
3. Implement real-time calculation updates when inputs change
4. Add validation for all input fields with appropriate error messages
5. Ensure responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
6. Implement clear visual indicators for alerts (e.g., bonus exceeding 3x base salary)
7. Create a calculation breakdown display that shows all intermediate steps
8. Use Tailwind CSS for styling as specified in the PRD

Components to create:
- InputField (reusable numeric input with validation)
- Slider (for weights and other percentage inputs)
- ToolTip (for explanatory text)
- ResultDisplay (for showing the final bonus amount)
- BreakdownTable (for showing calculation steps)
- AlertBanner (for policy breaches)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all UI components
2. Integration tests for form validation
3. E2E tests for complete calculation flow
4. Responsive design tests across different screen sizes
5. Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
6. Performance testing to ensure UI updates within 500ms
7. User testing with representative users from the target audience

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design layout and component architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create wireframes and define the overall UI structure for the calculator interface
### Details:
Design the overall layout including header, input sections, results display, and calculation breakdown area. Create responsive grid system that works across devices. Define component hierarchy and data flow between components. Prepare design mockups for approval before implementation.

## 2. Implement input components with validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop all form input elements with appropriate validation logic
### Details:
Create reusable input components (text fields, dropdowns, sliders, etc.) with proper labeling and accessibility features. Implement client-side validation for each input type with appropriate error messages. Add input masking for specialized fields (currency, percentages, etc.). Ensure tab navigation works correctly between inputs.

## 3. Build real-time calculation engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement the logic for performing calculations as users input values
### Details:
Create calculation service that processes input values and returns results. Implement debouncing to prevent excessive calculations during rapid input. Add event listeners to trigger recalculations when inputs change. Develop formula parser if complex calculations are needed. Ensure calculations handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.

## 4. Develop results display with breakdown [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create the UI components that show calculation results and detailed breakdowns
### Details:
Design and implement the results display area with clear formatting. Create expandable/collapsible sections for detailed calculation breakdowns. Add visualization components (charts, graphs) if needed. Implement print/export functionality for results. Ensure results update smoothly without jarring UI changes.

## 5. Implement responsive design and final styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Ensure the UI works across all device sizes and apply final visual styling
### Details:
Test and refine responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. Implement media queries for layout adjustments at different breakpoints. Apply final visual styling according to design system (colors, typography, spacing, etc.). Add transitions and animations for improved user experience. Conduct final accessibility review (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
