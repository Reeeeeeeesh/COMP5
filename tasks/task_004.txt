# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Investment Performance Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the investment performance component of the calculator with adjustable parameters as specified in FR3.2.
# Details:
1. Create UI components for investment performance inputs:
   - Input fields for individual fund alphas (in basis points)
   - Input fields for AUM weight per fund
   - Adjustable parameters for the alpha-to-multiplier mapping curve
   - Input for the overall Investment Weight

2. Implement calculation functions:
   - Calculate weighted alpha based on individual fund alphas and AUM weights
   - Implement the alpha-to-multiplier mapping function with configurable parameters
   - Calculate the investment component contribution to the bonus

3. Provide option to input the Investment Score Multiplier directly as an alternative

4. Implement real-time updates of the investment component as inputs change

5. Add validation for all inputs with appropriate constraints

The alpha-to-multiplier mapping should support configuration of:
- Alpha value for 1x payout
- Alpha value for max payout
- Maximum payout multiplier

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all calculation functions
2. Test with various alpha values and weights to verify correct multiplier calculation
3. Test the direct input option for Investment Score Multiplier
4. Test edge cases (very high/low alpha values)
5. Verify real-time updates work correctly
6. Test with the truth table cases from section 11 of the PRD
