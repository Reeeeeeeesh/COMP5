# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 15, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to meet the requirements specified in NFR1.
# Details:
1. Optimize frontend performance:
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Implement memoization for expensive calculations
   - Use efficient rendering techniques (e.g., virtualized lists for large data sets)
   - Optimize state management to minimize re-renders

2. Optimize backend performance:
   - Implement database query optimization
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize batch processing with parallel execution
   - Implement efficient file parsing for batch uploads

3. Implement performance monitoring:
   - Track key performance metrics
   - Set up alerts for performance degradation
   - Create performance dashboards

4. Optimize API communication:
   - Minimize payload sizes
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Use efficient data formats

5. Implement load testing and performance benchmarking

The performance optimizations should ensure that the application meets the specified performance requirements: <500ms for individual calculations, <3 seconds for page load, and appropriate processing times for batch calculations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance benchmarking for individual calculations
2. Load testing for batch processing
3. Measure and verify page load times
4. Test with large datasets to ensure performance at scale
5. Profile CPU and memory usage
6. Test on various devices and network conditions
7. Verify that optimizations don't compromise functionality or accuracy
