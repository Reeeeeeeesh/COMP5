# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Batch Export Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to export batch calculation results to CSV or Excel as specified in FR7.5.
# Details:
1. Design and implement UI for batch export options:
   - Button or menu for export options
   - Options for CSV or Excel export
   - Options for selecting which columns to include

2. Implement export functions:
   - Generate CSV file with calculation results for all employees
   - Generate Excel file with formatted results and possibly multiple sheets
   - Include all relevant data (inputs, intermediate calculations, results, alerts)

3. Optimize for large exports:
   - Stream data to file rather than loading all in memory
   - Show progress indicator for large exports
   - Handle timeouts gracefully

4. Format exported data for readability:
   - Include headers and column descriptions
   - Format numbers appropriately (currency, percentages)
   - Highlight alerts and caps

5. Include metadata in export:
   - Timestamp
   - Batch name/ID
   - Summary statistics
   - Applied global parameters

The batch export functionality should provide a complete record of the calculation results that can be saved, shared, or imported into other systems.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for export functions
2. Test CSV and Excel generation with various result sets
3. Test with large datasets to ensure performance
4. Verify that all relevant data is included in the export
5. Test formatting of numbers and dates
6. Test inclusion of metadata
7. Test with various browsers to ensure compatibility
