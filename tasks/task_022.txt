# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Visualizations for Individual Calculator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement visual representations of calculation components and sensitivity as specified in FR1.5.
# Details:
1. Design and implement visualization components:
   - Pie chart for bonus composition (showing relative contribution of investment and qualitative components)
   - Bar chart for sensitivity analysis (showing impact of changes to key inputs)
   - Line chart for parameter mapping curves (e.g., alpha-to-multiplier, score-to-multiplier)

2. Implement interactive features:
   - Tooltips showing exact values
   - Ability to toggle between different visualization types
   - Highlighting of relevant sections based on user interaction

3. Ensure visualizations update in real-time as inputs change

4. Make visualizations accessible and include alternative text representations

5. Optimize visualizations for performance

The visualizations should help users understand the composition of the bonus calculation and the impact of different inputs on the final result.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for visualization components
2. Test visualizations with various data sets
3. Test real-time updates as inputs change
4. Test accessibility features
5. Test performance with frequent updates
6. Test browser compatibility
7. User testing to ensure visualizations are intuitive and helpful
