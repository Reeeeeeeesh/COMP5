# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Session Management for Anonymous Users
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop session management for anonymous users to securely handle batch data without requiring authentication as specified in section 15.
# Details:
1. Design and implement session management system:
   - Generate secure session IDs for anonymous users
   - Store session data securely
   - Implement session timeout (24 hours as specified in section 15)
   - Handle session recovery (e.g., via browser cookie or local storage)

2. Implement data scoping based on session:
   - Associate uploaded batch data with session ID
   - Scope batch scenarios to session ID
   - Ensure users can only access their own data

3. Implement data cleanup:
   - Automatically delete data after session timeout (24 hours)
   - Delete data after batch job completion if requested
   - Provide option for manual data deletion

4. Add session management UI elements:
   - Session status indicator
   - Session timeout warning
   - Option to extend session

5. Implement security measures to prevent session hijacking

The session management system should provide a secure way to handle user data without requiring authentication while still ensuring data privacy and implementing proper data retention policies.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for session management functions
2. Test session creation and validation
3. Test data scoping to ensure users can only access their own data
4. Test session timeout and data cleanup
5. Test session recovery after browser refresh
6. Security testing for session ID generation and protection
7. Test concurrent sessions from the same browser
8. Test session handling across different browsers and devices
