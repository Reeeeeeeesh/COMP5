# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Sensitivity Analysis for Individual Calculations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop sensitivity analysis functionality with sliders for key inputs as specified in FR5.3.
# Details:
1. Design and implement UI for sensitivity analysis:
   - Sliders for key inputs (Investment Score, Qualitative Score, RAF, etc.)
   - Real-time display of how changing each input affects the final bonus
   - Visual representation of sensitivity (e.g., small chart showing impact)

2. Implement sensitivity calculation functions:
   - Calculate bonus for a range of values for each key input
   - Determine which inputs have the greatest impact on the final bonus
   - Calculate percentage change in bonus for a given percentage change in input

3. Create visual representations of sensitivity:
   - Mini-charts showing bonus amount vs. input value
   - Color coding to indicate high/medium/low sensitivity

4. Ensure real-time updates as sliders are moved

The sensitivity analysis should help users understand which inputs have the greatest impact on the final bonus calculation and how changes to those inputs affect the result.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for sensitivity calculation functions
2. Test with various input ranges to verify correct sensitivity calculations
3. Test the real-time updates as sliders are moved
4. Test with edge cases (inputs near caps or clamps)
5. Verify that the visual representations accurately reflect the sensitivity
6. Performance testing to ensure smooth slider operation
