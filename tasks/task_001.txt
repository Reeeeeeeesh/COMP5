# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite for frontend and Python 3.11, FastAPI for backend as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Setup frontend structure:
   - Initialize with Vite: `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts`
   - Install Tailwind CSS: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
   - Configure Tailwind: `npx tailwindcss init -p`
   - Setup basic folder structure (components, hooks, services, utils, types)
3. Setup backend structure:
   - Create Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Install FastAPI: `pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]`
   - Install Pydantic: `pip install pydantic`
   - Setup basic folder structure (routes, models, services, utils)
4. Configure ESLint and Prettier for frontend
5. Configure pre-commit hooks
6. Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
7. Setup basic CI/CD pipeline for testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the repository structure follows best practices
2. Ensure all development dependencies are correctly installed
3. Verify that the frontend development server starts without errors
4. Verify that the backend server starts without errors
5. Run linting checks to ensure code style consistency

# Subtasks:
## 1. Repository Creation and Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the GitHub repository with proper naming conventions and initial folder structure
### Details:
Create a new repository with a clear naming convention that includes project name and technology stack. Initialize with README.md, .gitignore, and LICENSE files. Set up the basic folder structure including /src, /docs, /build, and separate directories for frontend and backend code.

## 2. Frontend Initialization [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the frontend framework and dependencies
### Details:
Choose and initialize the frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). Set up package.json with necessary dependencies, configure build tools like webpack or vite, and create the initial component structure. Include asset directories for images, styles, and other static resources.

## 3. Backend Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize the backend framework and database connections
### Details:
Set up the backend framework (Node.js/Express, Django, Rails, etc.). Configure database connections, create initial API endpoints, and set up environment configuration. Establish folder structure for models, controllers, routes, and services.

## 4. Linting and Formatting Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up code quality tools for consistent code style
### Details:
Configure ESLint, Prettier, or other linting tools appropriate for the tech stack. Create configuration files (.eslintrc, .prettierrc) with rule sets. Set up editor configuration (.editorconfig) to ensure consistent formatting across different development environments.

## 5. Pre-commit Hooks Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Configure Git hooks to enforce code quality before commits
### Details:
Install and configure Husky or similar tool for Git hooks. Set up pre-commit hooks to run linters, formatters, and tests before allowing commits. Create configuration files for lint-staged to only check modified files for efficiency.

## 6. Documentation Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create comprehensive project documentation structure
### Details:
Set up documentation framework and structure. Create README with project overview, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. Add API documentation templates, architecture diagrams, and developer guides. Establish a consistent documentation format and location within the repository.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment workflows
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD tool. Create workflow files for building, testing, and deploying the application. Set up separate environments for development, staging, and production. Configure automated testing and quality checks as part of the pipeline.
